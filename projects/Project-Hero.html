                    Project Hero is an idea that was created through a course I took at Illinois Institute of Technology called:

                <blockquote>
                    <em>Interprofessional Projects Program (IPRO) - Big Data Science & the Urban Experience Challenge</em>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The main objective of this course was to develop insights from large data sets that can inspire solutions to human needs in the urban environment. Although our project didn't necessarily use big data in the end, it did help us along the way with figuring out our idea and mission.

                    A significant number of Chicago high school students from low income communities are not pursuing a college education because of cultural barriers that discourage the continuation of their educational journey after high school.

                    This affects every community as low enrollment percentages correlate to high crime rates. Said another way, it costs taxpayers billions of dollars every year in crime related expenses.

                    Our mission as Project Hero, is to establish an internet based awareness campaign that provides a platform to connect Chicagoâ€™s youth with successful, college educated professionals within their communities. Through this online tool we hope to increase the number of individuals pursuing a higher education through the empowerment of high school students from everyday heroes within their communities.
