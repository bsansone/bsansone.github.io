                        Working out, playing sports and especially lifting weights is a big hobby and interest in my life at the moment. Having just started lifting at the beginning of summer 2015 and having a goal to gain 15 pounds from where I was at, which I accomplished! I hope to see more progress and change in myself the upcoming summer while I continue this new hobby.

                        A interest of mine that I've had since as long as I can remember is video games, specifically PC games and in the last few years...<a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/">League of Legends</a>. I've been playing this game since a little after beta and have made tons of friends and learned a ton about teamwork and strategy. After climbing the ranks from lowly bronze tier in season 1 to reaching almost master tier in season 4, I have learned a lot and enjoyed every minute of it, even with all the feeders...
